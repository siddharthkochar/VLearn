ðŸŽ¬ VLearn - Advantages of AI-Assisted Development Over Traditional Development
================================================================================

Planning Mode
==============
Planning with LLM gives a lot of clarity on different ways to implement and problem solving approach. AI has a knowledge of whole internet, it make sense a lot of sense to ask him for recommendations, question his approach, and plan the activity instead of directly asking him to complete a task. This approach helped me to learn a lot of new things which I wasn't aware of it and in the process we are also teaching AI our style, best practises and processes we follow. Once this is established, development is way faster.

Other Advantages
=================

AI-Assisted 
â€¢ 60-80% faster code generation for boilerplate and repetitive tasks
â€¢ Instant code suggestions reduce typing time and syntax lookups
â€¢ Automated generation of model classes, interfaces, and service implementations
â€¢ Context-aware completions eliminate need for constant documentation reference
â€¢ Rapid prototyping capabilities enable faster proof-of-concept development
â€¢ Reduced time spent on mechanical coding tasks allows focus on architecture
â€¢ Better code quality with automatic error handing
â€¢ Reduction of learning curve and learn by development

Traditional Development Challenges:
â€¢ Manual typing of all code including repetitive boilerplate
â€¢ Frequent context switching to documentation and reference materials
â€¢ Time-consuming creation of standard patterns and implementations
â€¢ Slower iteration cycles due to mechanical coding overhead
â€¢ More time spent on syntax and API lookups rather than problem-solving
