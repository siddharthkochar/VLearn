ðŸŽ¬ VLearn V2 - Why Copilot suggestion is agreed or accepted
===============================================================

Instead of providing details and directly asking to implement the requirement, I've spend significant time with Claude Sonnet 4 to plan this project. This planning mode which includes following things:

Plan Feature Delivery:
- Sharing the detailed requirements
- Setting up the context of this activity
- Prioritize the core requirements over advanced features
- Getting LLMs recommendations which fit the needs of this activity

Development Process:
- Create a trackable step by step plan for the development
- Plan for task with small steps
- Setup actions to verify the code for any implementation/logical errors
- Actions to test the code with sample inputs
- Manual review of code
- Detailed Commit and push after each Phase of development.

GitHub Copilot suggestions were accepted because they are technically sound. Although I have to ask to keep things simple for POC while the suggestions were for Enterprise level software. The combination of AI assistance and human judgment resulted in a higher quality product delivered in less time than traditional development approaches.
