Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

AI and ML are transformative technologies that are reshaping how we solve complex problems. Machine learning allows computers to learn patterns from data without being explicitly programmed for each specific task.

Key concepts include:
- Supervised learning: Training with labeled data
- Unsupervised learning: Finding patterns in unlabeled data  
- Neural networks: Models inspired by the human brain
- Deep learning: Neural networks with multiple layers

These technologies are being applied across industries from healthcare to finance, enabling automation, prediction, and decision-making at unprecedented scale.
