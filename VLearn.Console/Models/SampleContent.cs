    public const string PhotosynthesisContent = @"Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods with the help of chlorophyll. During this process, plants convert carbon dioxide from the air and water from the soil into glucose (sugar) and oxygen. The chemical equation for photosynthesis is: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy â†’ C6H12O6 + 6O2. This process is essential for life on Earth as it produces oxygen that we breathe and forms the base of most food chains.";

    public const string ArtificialIntelligenceContent = @"Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. AI systems can perform tasks such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. There are different types of AI: Narrow AI (designed for specific tasks), General AI (human-level intelligence across domains), and Superintelligence (exceeding human intelligence). Machine learning, a subset of AI, enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed for every task.";

    public const string ClimateChangeContent = @"Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns. While climate variations occur naturally, scientific evidence shows that human activities since the Industrial Revolution have been the primary driver of recent climate change. The burning of fossil fuels releases greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, creating a 'greenhouse effect' that traps heat. This leads to rising global temperatures, melting ice caps, sea level rise, and extreme weather events. Addressing climate change requires reducing greenhouse gas emissions and transitioning to renewable energy sources.";
