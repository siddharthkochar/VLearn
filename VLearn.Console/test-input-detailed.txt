Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed for every scenario.

Key Concepts:
1. Supervised Learning - Learning from labeled examples
2. Unsupervised Learning - Finding patterns in unlabeled data  
3. Reinforcement Learning - Learning through trial and error

Popular algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, neural networks, and support vector machines. These algorithms power applications like recommendation systems, fraud detection, medical diagnosis, and predictive analytics.

The machine learning process typically involves data collection, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment. Success depends on having quality data, choosing appropriate algorithms, and proper validation techniques.
